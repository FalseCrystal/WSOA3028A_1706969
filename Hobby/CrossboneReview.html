                <p id="Introduction">
                    This review of the Crossbone Gundam will be the first in a long overdue series of my thoughts on the plastic models that I have gotten around to building recently. 
                    <br>
                    Of the three that I have assembled, I chose this one because … 
                    Quite frankly, while I like the aesthetic design, I have problems with it or maybe it has problems with me but I’m sure it’s the former.
                </p>

                  
                
                <p id="Pros">
                    I’m not gonna lie, I really like the look of this model which is mostly due to its mantle although it could just be the edgy teen in me fan boying over it.
                    Its array of weapons also gives a lot of options to play around with when deciding on poses for display.

                <p id="Cons">
                    This however brings me to my first issue, being that this model has got far too much going on for its size. 
                    It is just a hassle to try and manoeuvre its different parts in a way you want without knocking another part 
                    out of place or being obstructed and it just gets more frustrating when working with the mantle pieces and arm attachments 
                    that are either too loose or too rigid at the connection points. 
                    I had a much happier time planning poses by just ignoring them which is still annoying since there’s a lot of equipment that sorta relies on those pieces.

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    My problems with this model are totally not because of my lack of experience in the hobby or 
                    patience in learning new things that lead me to breaking a part or three.
