                </h2>

                <p id="Introduction">
                    So in hindsight, I realise that I should’ve started off the blog with what Gunpla is so that's the agenda of today’s post. 
                    But before we get to what Gunpla is, 
                    I feel it’s probably a good idea to skim over its origins and history in Gundam.

                <h2>
                    Brief History of the Gundam Franchise
                </h2>

                <p id="Brief summary of the Gundam franchise">
                    Gundam is a science-fiction multi-media franchise that was created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise inc. 
                    (a japanese animation studio) in 1979 and owned by Bandai Namco Holdings 
                    (a company that specialises in toys, games, animation, arcades and amusement parks).  
                    The franchise started off as a sci-fi animation series in which wars were fought using giant robots and 
                    has produced many different series and spin-offs of the franchise. It has also branched out into many other mediums in the form of novels, 
                    manga (japanese comics), video games and plastic model kits known as Gunpla.       
                </p>
                
                <h2>Should you consider picking it up as a hobby</h2>

                <p id="Why Gunpla intro">
                    While Gunpla is marketed to fans of the series, 
                    there are a lot of reasons to get into the hobby even if you’ve never heard of it before but 
                    there are also a few things to note that might push people away from it as well. 
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Skill barrier ?
                </h2>
                
                <p id="Entry level description">
                    Gunpla from a skill point of view is relatively easy to start but does take time in improving your skills. 
                    Each kit comes with its own instruction manual. Yes, the instructions are only ever in Japanese. 
                    No, this isn’t really a problem.
                    The manual gives easy to follow key visuals for assembling the model but isn’t particularly strict in how you approach it, 
                    so it affords some leeway in how you build it and how much you want to change or customize the kit as well.      
                </p>

                <h2>
                    The boundary of participation
                </h2>

                <p id="Freedom in how much one wants to participate">
                    Gunpla isn’t just assembling a model, although it is the cheapest way to interact with the hobby. 
                    There are a lot of different and creative ways in which a person can expand their experience with Gunpla and 
                    it's entirely up to them in which direction they want to take it. You could make a model more realistic 
                    (as realistic as a sci-fi robot can be) using different paints and 
                    coating to give it a more metallic shine or use a knife to cut in more detailed panel linings. 
                    You can weather a model to mimic different conditions that you could expect it to go through in the 
                    tv series by using paint or even damaging the parts in different ways. 
                    You can even take different model kits and try to make some kind of mechanical monstrosity or robot waifu or something. 
                    There’s so much you can do and so many ways to do it with varying results so there’s a lot to experiment and play around with.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Cost and Accessibility
                </h2>
 
                <p id="Cost and Accessibility">
                    Of course everything has its costs and some of the examples above look pretty pricey. 
                    Gunpla have differing grades depending on the size of the model and 
                    level of detail and will be our main concern at the entry level. 
                    This is because we don’t require anything else besides the model if we just want to assemble it. 
                    The cheaper kits can be anything between R150 - R300 but the costs get considerably higher the further you 
                    go into the hobby with more expensive models and paints as well as import taxes if you’re anywhere outside of Asia.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Community
                </h2>

                <p id="Community">
                    On the bright side, there is support from both the community and the company itself that help widen the overall reach and 
                    accessibility of the franchise and hobby. For starters, there’s the official Gundam portal website and youtube channel Gundam Info. 
                    These platforms hold a variety of content from the franchise including streaming services for the series as well as news and stores for Gunpla. 
                    Bandai also hosts the Gundam Builder World Cup annually which is a competition open to various regions around the world
                     (except Africa as far as I’m aware) with junior and open divisions. While I personally am unaware of any local community, 
                     there’s a lot of content creators on youtube like MechaGaikotsu or ZakuAurelius that provide a lot of news and advice. 
                    There’s also a reddit for Gunpla that can give you an idea about how hobbyists feel about as well as the relevant costs. 
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Conclusion
                </h2>

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    To summarise, Gunpla has a lot of accessibility issues if you’re anywhere outside of Asia, 
                    meaning you’d generally have to rely on online stores and platforms to get any news or kits. 
                    With regards to South Africa, the stores that have Gunpla kits are few and far between with selection being fairly small. 
                    Leaving that aside, the hobby is fairly easy to get into and gives people the freedom to do as much or little as they want to with it.
