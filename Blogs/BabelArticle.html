                    The Library of babel likens the world as many infinite libraries made up of all the information and data in the world as well as each personal understanding of it. 
                    It speaks of the continual search for understanding that takes generations of time to develop, as well as how to make the research and development of the specific information we’re looking for faster.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What’s interesting to note is the type interaction between people of differing beliefs in which said understandings try to overwrite each other to validate themselves rather than potentially improve themselves.
                    It shows a worrying mindset of the pursuit of knowledge and flaunting what was found rather than understanding and continually taking different outlooks to further that understanding.
                    The ease of access to information that the internet gives us is no different than the library of babel since it, at its core, is something that consists of human libraries and therefore still requires time for people to evaluate different sources before coming to a proper conclusion.
                    While the internet itself has made the search process significantly more efficient, it has not changed the desire to affirm what one knows as “the truth”. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a way the efficiency that the internets speed has brought can be considered mitigated by the speed at which conflicting information and arguments can occur on it.
