                <h2>
                    Introduction
                </h2>

                <p>
                    This article is a style guide for the website. This guide acts as a rationale for many of the design choices made for the site.
                </p>

                <h2>
                   Typography 
                </h2>
               
                <p>
                    We use differing font sizes from largest to smallest to signify difference in importance in meaning. For Headings, H1 is at 
                    30px and is the largest font size that will represent the title of a webpage.
                    <br>
                    H2 should be the 2nd largest font size to represent 
                    each section that is contained on the webpage. In this case it is 25px. H3 and paragraphs are at 20px, with the same size 
                    representing equal weight and importance. H3 also represents any subsections within H2.
                    <br>
                    The aside font size is the smallest 
                    as it features the least on a webpage, is seperate from the main content and therefore has the least importance.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Color Scheme
                </h2>
            
                <p>
                    Lighter colors such as yellow and gray where chosen for the navigation and buttons as we desire enough contrast for them to stand out
                    , however they don't draw so much attention that it distracts users from the main contents of the web page.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Images
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Image sizes are restricted to 50% and 20% width of the screen. 50% size is reserved for images that go with the web pages title
                     and helps get the title message accross more clearly. The 20% size is for any other image used on a webpage. Percentages are used
                     to keep the webpage responsive to different sizes of a browser screen.
                     Ensure that images excluding the introductory have a suitable caption and are positioned under the paragraph of text in which they are mentioned
                     this is to keep the flow of traversal from being broken for the user. 
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Element formatting
                </h2>

                <p>
                    To ensure that webpages are easy to navigate and traverse through we keep the navigation bar fixed at the top of the screen with 
                    it's label and respective buttons. Following this is the body and main content of the webpage with its different H, section and article tags.
                    The margins for text on the screen is set to 60% of the screens with and is justified. This is to keep the text in the general center of the screen 
                    , making it easier to view content without having to shift ones gaze left and right continously in the case of wide screens.
