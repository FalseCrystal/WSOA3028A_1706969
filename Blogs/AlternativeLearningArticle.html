                <p id="Introduction Paragraph">
                    Online learning is a powerful tool that could play a large role in making higher education more accessible. 
                    However there are a number of factors to take into consideration. 
                    These include cost limitations with regards to data as well as access to facilities like computers. 
                    This article will discuss the type of technologies available for online learning and the difficulties it faces in a 
                    South African context including emergency situations like the currently ongoing Covid-19 Shut down.
                </p>
            
                <h2>
                    Limitations
                </h2>

                <p id="Limitation Introduction">
                    Let us first discuss the cost limitations and requirements for accessing online learning. 
                    There are three requirements. The first is a device that has networking capabilities such as a smart phone or computer. 
                    While mobile devices work well enough for accessing text, audio and video based resources, 
                    one may require a computer's capabilities in order to run software for certain courses. 
                    The second requirement is data that enables the mentioned devices to connect to the internet and access online resources. 
                    The last requirement is infrastructure in terms of both network coverage.
                </p>

                <p id="Cost Accessibility">
                    South Africa faces a number of problems that make meeting these requirements difficult. 
                    The most notable disparity of income among the population with the majority living in poverty . 
                    This limits the accessibility of online learning to a large portion of the populace. 
                    Many universities offer on campus facilities that help circumvent these limitations. 
                    The University of South Africa (UNISA) adopts a Open Distance Learning system and makes use of telecentres that 
                    provide computer facilities to students in areas with limited access(Letseka et al,2018). 
                    However , South Africa is currently in shutdown due to the Covid-19 virus making these facilities inaccessible 
                    as many are forced to return and stay home to prevent the spread of the virus. 
                    While some universities are taking the initiative to supply both data, 
                    zero-rated services as well as laptops to students in need, there is one more problem to consider. 
                </p>

                <p id="Infrastructure Accessibility">
                    The final problem to be discussed is South Africa’s infrastructure with regards to network coverage. 
                    While South Africa does have basic network coverage around the country, 
                    it’s quality, reliability and accessibility remains something to be desired at a national level. 
                    While the more economically active and developed areas of South Africa that includes Johannesburg or Cape Town 
                    have access to fast and reliable internet connections the same can not be said of the remaining areas in which 
                    the speed and connectivity is far from desirable (Matthews,2018). 
                    Therefore, even though there are actions being taken to supply students with the necessary facilities and resources, 
                    online learning during shutdown is currently far from ideal for those living in areas with poorer network coverage and 
                    may not actually be able to assist all those who are in need.
                </p>

                <p id="Limitations Conclusion">
                    The unfortunate reality is that the aforementioned problems are deeply rooted and there is no immediate solution that 
                    ensures that all people get through the current crisis unaffected. 
                    All that can be realistically done is to make online learning as accessible as possible, 
                    even if it is far from ideal in the current situation.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Available Technologies
                </h2>

                <p id="Techologies Introduction">
                    This section will list the different technologies available for online learning. 
                    It will also discuss how the bandwidth cost and responsiveness of the technology can affect the 
                    structure and accessibility of the course(2020,Stanford).
                </p>

                <p id="Low Bandwidth/Responsiveness">
                    Starting with the most accessible technology we have online forums, documents and email. 
                    They have a relatively low bandwidth cost to view and provide a platform in which course information 
                    and resources can be distributed and accessed fairly easily. 
                    The responsiveness of this technology varies as users may be unsure of when others have seen and answered 
                    their questions on the platform. 
                    However, this uncertainty can be mitigated by organising designated times in which lecturers or tutors will be 
                    online and available. 
                    Posts and messages will be archived on the forum for all users to view whenever they need to as well. 
                    This can easily get chaotic to navigate through but can become a very effective medium with proper organisation 
                    and regulations in its use. Many institutions use Learning Management Systems (LRMs) 
                    like Sakai or myUnisa (Letseka,2018) to this effect.
                </p>

                <p id="Low Bandwidth High Responsiveness">
                    Another technology with a similar bandwidth would be online collaborative document editors like google drives and 
                    group chat services. 
                    Collaborative documents can be viewed at any given moment like online forums and resources. 
                    It differs in that it allows multiple users to edit and work on a single document at the same time and 
                    also provides a platform in which they can comment and discuss different parts of a document on one webpage. 
                    Slack is a useful group chat service that allows users to communicate with each other quickly. 
                    It also has the functionality of allocating deadlines and tasks to individual members which is useful in a group project setting. 
                    Like the technologies mentioned in the previous section, they are versatile in the when they can be accessed, 
                    however they still require proper organisation and structure to be utilised effectively.
                </p>

                <p id="High Bandwidth Introduction">
                    The next two technologies will be the most costly in terms of bandwidth 
                    but will provide services that are the closest to live lectures and will be more engaging than reading plain text documents.
                </p>

                <p id="Live Streaming">
                    The technology that offers services that mirrors live lectures the most would be live streaming and 
                    video conferencing which allows users to view lectures and communicate with each other in real time. 
                    Unfortunately the pay-off is that streaming videos at a decent quality will have a high cost in bandwidth 
                    even if learners were just viewing the stream. Areas with poor network coverage or slow speeds will likely be unable to engage 
                    with the lecture in a meaningful as connection to the stream can cut out or output poor audio and video.Giving a lecture using 
                    streaming can also be a bit clunky in cases where students don’t own microphones and 
                    have to rely on text messages to ask questions which may take some time before being noticed. 
                </p>

                <p id="Pre-recorded Videos">
                    These issues can be worked around through the use of pre-recorded lectures. 
                    While bandwidth for viewing them will only differ slightly, 
                    it is a more reliable way in presenting lectures in a video format where internet speed and stability is an issue. 
                    This is due to the fact the learners can pause the video and wait for it to buffer fully before viewing or 
                    they can download it to avoid buffering repeatedly. Learners can then use forums to ask questions and 
                    comment on video lectures if need be which provides a cheaper alternative to video/audio conferencing. 
                    There are some factors that need to be considered for this to be implemented effectively and accessibly. 
                    The lectures need to be structured into sections so that each lecture is recorded at a reasonable length 
                    (20 minutes maximum). This is to produce content that is more digestible and 
                    engaging for the students and also takes file size and network stability into consideration as it is difficult 
                    to download large files on a slow or unstable network.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Conclusion
                </h2>

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    In conclusion, 
                    online learning is far from ideal in South Africa due to economic and 
                    infrastructural problems that limits its accessibility from the majority of the population. 
                    Given the situation, it is difficult to ensure that all students will be able to get through this time of crisis unaffected. 
                    However it is important that measures be taken in an attempt to make online learning as accessible as possible. 
                    Low bandwidth technologies such as online forums should be the backbone to 
                    ensuring that online learning is accessible and affordable while pre-recorded lectures should be used over video conferencing.
