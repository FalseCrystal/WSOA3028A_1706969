                        One of its core messages is how the medium tends to be overshadowed by the content it conveys, 
                        both from a value and moral point of view. 
                        What must be considered is that while the morality and value of technology is decided by its users,
                        different technologies were made for specific purposes that assists humans in various activities.
                        The convenience it provides often encourages how often the medium is used for their specific functions which shows in a current society regarding communication and social media.
                        Likewise, the development of weapons has made it all the easier for people to defend themselves and just as easily harm others.
