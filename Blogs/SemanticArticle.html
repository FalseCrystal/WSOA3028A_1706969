                        Semantic Markup is basically a language that makes use of tags in order to structure html pages.
                        Each tag is unique and conveys different types of information such as hierarchy or importance within the page.
                        It also assists in communicating information about the web page to other machines or programs like bots.

                        Semantic markup is important as it provides a standardised language in which one can read and assess the 
                        information and structure of a html web page. This standardisation helps both human and bot users alike as it
                        creates a common ground for understanding a web pages elements, making its information more accessible.
                        It also becomes very efficient in navigating and gathering
                        the vast amount of information found on the web through automated data gathering via bots in search engines.
                        This increase in accessibility also improves the rate of development regarding the internet and web services.

                        In summary, Semantic Markup is a language that helps both people and machines read information contained in 
                        a webpage as well as how it's structured. This standardisation makes a web page more accessible and therefore 
                        improves the efficiency of the web as well as the development of web services.
