                <p>
                    The Library of babel likens the world as many infinite libraries made up of all the information and data in the world as well as each personal understanding of it. 
                    It speaks of the continual search for understanding that takes generations of time to develop, as well as how to make the research and development of the specific information weâ€™re looking for faster.

                    Reflection on Browser wars and the reactive nature to possible problems of new technology.
                </h3>
               
                <p>
                    With rises in technological development, we find various aspects of our daily lives changing for the better 
                    and with these changes come many opportunities. However, these changes may be happening too quickly for our 
                    general understanding with regards to possible future drawbacks that may arise from these changes.
                    <br>
                    This article uses the Browser war court case between Netscape and Microsoft to discuss how the advantages 
                    of new technology may blind us from its possible misuse and prevents us from creating countermeasures before any major 
                    damage is suffered.

                <p>
                    Hypertext plays an important role in how we navigate information on the World Wide Web. While it provides a fast

                    development.

                    This Article explains how navigating the WWW with hypertext works and how its influence on the WWW may affect how our society
                     behaves.
