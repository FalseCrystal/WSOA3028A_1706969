                    In a time where technologies are constantly developing,
                    it is important to note how those technologies are used by both companies/developers and users. 
                    Considerations towards how these new technologies fit in to current legislature, economy and society must be made. 
                    This is to ensure that the technology is used in a fair and ethical manner in each sphere.
                </p>

                    From the previous reading, As we may think, we find that while technological development and innovations may bring various advantages to everyday life, it is often driven by financial viability.
                    This by itself presents no problems, however the anti-trust court case involving Netscape and Microsoft reveals a big problem when dealing with emerging markets that deal in new innovations.
                    The primary problem in the court case was the business practices that Microsoft employed to hinder the progress of other companies in developing newer technologies.
                    These practices basically forced possible future competitors to either go bankrupt or be bought out by Microsoft, essentially creating a monopoly over the computer software industry at the time.

                    Government enforced limitations over Microsoft thanks to the anti-trust court case.
                    The resulting legislature regarding the case pushed for competitivity to prevent monopolies, after all who else would sooner point out foul or unethical play if not oneâ€™s own rivals.
                    However, it is important to note that the development of software is often very fast in comparison to the speed of court proceedings and legislative matters.
                    By the time the case was settled, Netscape had already suffered significant losses.

                    It becomes evident that with the rapid growth in productivity that technology brings, there are also new problems that result from them.
                    Taking this case and past innovations such as the automobile into account, we can see that possible consequences and how to deal with them are only considered after the effects have taken hold.
