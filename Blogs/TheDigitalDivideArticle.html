                <h2>
                    Introduction
                </h2>

                <p id="Introduction Paragraph">
                    The digital divide can simply be used to refer to the gap between people who have internet access and those that do not. 
                    However, It is important to note that there are multiple categories of divide with their effects, 
                    causes and implications are both layered and spread among a variety of fields (Steele,2019).
                </p>
            
                <h2>
                    The Divides
                </h2>

                <p id="Financial and infrastructural divides">
                    The first divide is the difference in technological and infrastructural development between countries. 
                    This issue is also linked to each country's economic situation and leads to a number of other divisions that will be discussed later. 
                    When it comes to internet accessibility, 
                    we can see a trend in how countries with stronger economies have a higher internet usage than countries with less developed economies.
                    The access of affordability is restricted in a weaker economy as broadband costs can be over 200 times the average wage (Graham et al, 2015) 
                    and this does not include the affordability of any Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) that help us interface with the internet.
                    However affordability is not the only issue. 
                    Within South Africa we see affordable and fairly reliable internet access in more developed areas like Gauteng and Cape Town.
                    However, the percentage of internet penetration in the remainder of South Africa is only around 35% at best (Matthews,2018). 
                    This shows that a developed and widespread infrastructure is just as important as broadband affordability when it comes to access. 
                </p>

                <p id="Gender Divides">
                    While financial factors play a major role in accessibility, 
                    it is not the only factor to be considered in the digital divide. 
                    Within developing countries, there is a noticeable division in access between gender where men are 90% more likely to own a mobile phone, 
                    and by extension access to mobile networks, than women.
                </p>

                <p id="Universal Divides">
                    However, the divide does not only affect developing countries. 
                    Those with physical disabilities like blindness, 
                    may find a hard time interacting with the internet in cases where content is not produced with screen readers in mind. 
                    Digital literacy, or a lack thereof, 
                    also serves as a barrier that may prevent people from using the internet even if they have the resources to use them freely. 
                    This is due to how cumbersome its use is for those who are not used to certain technologies or unwilling to learn them.
                </p>

                <p id="Importance of bridging the gap">
                    Taking note of the divides and trying to close the gap in access is important as the internet can serve as a major tool in 
                    empowering people to overcome the many inequalities in the world. 
                    It serves as an important tool in distributing information that would otherwise be bound to their physical location. 
                    It serves as a global platform in which people of different cultures, 
                    beliefs and skills can communicate and the spread of awareness of differing people can set us on the road to 
                    understanding and collaborating for a better future. 
                    By extension, this scale of communication also allows economic growth as communication becomes easier and faster. 
                    Work opportunities can also present themselves in the same way with many online platforms and social media acting as a way 
                    of advertising one's skill set and portfolio.
                </p>

                <h2>
                   A New Digital Division
                </h2>

                <p id="Introduction of search engine algorithms and recommendation features">
                    Despite the current divides that we face and the importance of overcoming them, 
                    we also find ourselves at another digital divide that involves those who are able to use the internet without much difficulty. 
                    Through the internet and the various platforms it hosts, information has become increasingly accessible as previously mentioned. 
                    In platforms like Youtube, viewing content that we take interest in is becoming more and more convenient, 
                    with the platform itself learning what we enjoy and recommending more content based on what it's learnt. 
                    In the same vein, 
                    social networking platforms like Facebook have made it easier to maintain relationships over vast distances as well as creating new ones. 
                    Like Youtube, it also has recommendations features but for people that may share common interests. 
                    While these features give us much added convenience in surfing the internet, is there a point where things are too easy.
                </p>

                <p id="Possible increase in filter bubbles on web services">
                    Marco Faddoul (2020) tweeted some observations made on Tik Tok, 
                    a video sharing social media platform. 
                    He notices that the recommendation algorithm may be creating a filter bubble based on physical appearance 
                    in which similarities in gender, race, body type and even clothing styles. 
                    A filter bubble refers to a narrowed perspective created by search engine algorithms that give 
                    recommendations that a user will enjoy or agree with. 
                    While the feature itself is very useful, there are a number of concerns that need to be raised. 
                </p>

                <p id="Possible problems">
                    The first point to note is the possibility that recommendation algorithms are encouraging/enforcing confirmational bias. 
                    The internet holds an important role in shaping how we view the world. 
                    What we can’t see, 
                    access or engage with in some form on the internet can also infer the same level of interaction in our actual surroundings. 
                    While search recommendations are convenient they also serve to blind us from things we wouldn’t enjoy or agree with. 
                    This might not sound like a bad thing, but this may lead to the creation of communities that are numb to their own biases 
                    while overly sensitive to view points that differ or oppose their own
                    (Some Black Guy,2019 [This is actually his username, please don’t hurt me]).
                    This is counterproductive to what the internet can ideally achieve, 
                    like exposing and informing oneself to different places and cultures around the world to broaden and enrich one's own perspective.
                </p>

                <p id="Over and under representation">
                    While the search recommendation algorithm does play a huge role in this, 
                    it's not the only factor to consider. 
                    According to Towards a study of Information Geographies (Graham et al, 2015), 
                    internet access is heavily concentrated in the global north over the global south. 
                    According to their statistics many articles and contents regarding the global south are generally authored by those in the global north and this effect 
                    is due to both the lack of accessibility and cultural practices. 
                    This too serves to propagate confirmational biases and misinformation as those in the global south either 
                    don’t have access to the internet to review this information or the representation of their location is 
                    obscured by the overrepresentation of the global north on search engines, leaving them completely unaware of any misconceptions.
                </p>

                <p id="Example on the effects of obscuring information">
                    While these factors are important in accelerating this kind of behaviour as a norm, 
                    they alone are not the cause. 
                    Humans are social creatures and form communities in which we can communicate and collaborate with each other for our collective betterment, 
                    ideally. 
                    This of course assumes that all people in the world are good natured but the presence of these issues are evidence that this is not the case. 
                    In the Youtube video The Bizarre World of Fake Martial Arts 
                    (Super Eyepatch Wolf,2020 , Who knew procrastinating would be productive research), 
                    we can see how the lack or obscuring of information can have the same effects as the factors above. 
                    It also serves as an example of how problematic these filter bubbles can be on a global scale. 
                    The video discusses the early perceived mysticism of martial arts and how it 
                    created a community of people who truly believed that martial arts gave supernatural powers. 
                    However, the main point I want to draw on is the case that discusses what is considered a “cultural war” in China as 
                    it holds more relevance to the  point of this article. 
                    In summary,
                    the video describes China's cultural rejuvenation initiative to instill a sense of patriotism in Chinese youths with one of the
                     methods being the propagation of traditional martial arts through media and education. 
                     This led to the appearance of traditional martial artists claiming complete superiority over other forms. 
                     A local mixed martial artist voiced doubts over these claims and both him and his family were confronted by some of these martial artists. 
                     This resulted in a public exhibition match that resulted in the MMA fighters victory, 
                     however both the martial arts community and Chinese media discredited his victory as an attack on Chinese heritage and identity. 
                    The MMA fighter and his family then faced many restrictions and harassment by both the government and the public.  
                </p>

                <p id="Thoughts">
                    This story serves as an example as to how dangerous the obscuring of information (over representation) can be. 
                    It creates a bubble filtered community that is numb to their own biases and possible growth and 
                    can crush any opposing ideas even if there may be benefit in accepting and adapting them into their beliefs.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Conclusion
                </h2>

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    It is important that we try to bridge the gap in the digital divide as it can empower many 
                    people and helps us bridge the gap between many different inequalities that we face in our society. 
                    However, we must be aware of how these tools are used and how they can obscure our perception and 
                    enable the division of our digitally connected world by isolating ourselves in our own biases and intolerance.
