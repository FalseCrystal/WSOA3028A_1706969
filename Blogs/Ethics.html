                <p id="Introduction">
                    With newer technologies becoming more and more integrated with our daily lives, we can’t deny the influence they have over us. 
                    But does this influence go beyond simply using these technologies for their designed purposes ? 
                    This article discusses how design fits into our lives and what factors need to be considered in the ethical design of User Interface (UI) 
                    and User Experience (UX). While UI plays an important role in the legibility of a product, 
                    it is when it works in tandem with UX that it begins to show influence over us. 
                    Therefore, we will also be discussing the different aspects of UX and how they influence us to contextualize factors 
                    that need to be considered towards ethical design.
                </p>

                <p id="Design">
                    Design is a form of problem solving in which one tries to organise meaningful order(Papanek,1984). 
                    While design can be applied to a number of different fields,It comprises both visual representative components as well as purpose of function. 
                    If a tool can’t functionally fulfill its intended purpose it’s meaning is lost. 
                    However, this does not mean we should forsake appearance. 
                    Appearance can inform us of a tool's intended purpose and make it easier to use. 
                    If users can’t intuitively identify its use then the tool will likely be avoided to prevent any risk and confusion.
                    It therefore becomes important to balance between these two aspects when designing a beneficial product.
                </p>

                <p id="Aspects of Function">
                    While form and function are important to consider in developing a usable product, 
                    we must look past their function as tools and consider how they influence and relate to our lives before discussing ethical design. 
                    There are six aspects that form the usability and appearance of a functioning product (Papanek,1984). 
                    These can be summarised as: efficient production, purpose of use, perceived wants and needs, 
                    suitability of the product based on local culture and resource limitations, 
                    associated understanding and aesthetics.
                </p>

                <p id="Price Concerns">
                    Ideally, these interrelated ideas would lead to the development of technologies that are accessible 
                    (in terms of cost, distribution and usability) and beneficial to the people it was designed for. 
                    However with a more globally connected world, different technologies can now be distributed outside their intended locales. 
                    While this by itself is not a problem, as different technologies and practices can be useful to research and development, 
                    a concern rises when judging their value without properly understanding it. 
                    This resultant induced supply and demand over exotic goods is more about transparency and marketing when it comes to ethics.
                </p>

                <p id="Influence">
                    However, if we consider the mystifying of value in an online context a number of concerns arise. 
                    Firstly, while the internet can serve as an equaliser in information distribution, 
                    the way in which search engines operate can make it difficult to gain a wider understanding or context of a subject matter without conscious effort 
                    (For more details on information obscuration, Click here).
                     Secondly, with online banking and purchases we now have a platform in which we can spend money on more things and faster. 
                     Pairing these two points together can create a culture of detrimental spending habits on items of induced demand and value, 
                    in a similar manner to gambling.
                    <br>
                    From this, it is evident that design and technology holds an influence over us.
                    However it is important to note that while their effects and functions are dependent on the culture, 
                    resources and situation of each location. How different products are perceived, 
                    used and integrated itself would then also differ based on the culture it's interacting with. 
                    As a result, 
                    analysing the effects of a product on a culture or society as well as any ethical implication need to be looked at on a case by case basis. 
                    Furthermore, it is important to note that tools and technology influence and grow alongside the cultures that use them. 
                    This raises difficulties in identifying ethical concerns with regards to cultural impact and social norms.
                </p>

                <p id="Focus">
                    While there’s a number of techniques of design that improve usability and efficiency for users in UI and UX, 
                    there may be a need to evaluate the ethics of intuitive use versus conscious engagement. 
                    Intuitive use may emphasize efficiency and usability but speed and convenience may numb us from thinking about possible problems 
                    as its use becomes the norm. Designs that go against convention or are cumbersome to use often have an effect that makes people 
                    question how it is used but will also be less likely to be used because of it. 
                    Therefore a balance should be struck between the two in order to keep things usable and 
                    efficient while preventing the subconscious decay of conscious engagement and critical thinking.
                </p>

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    In summary, different technologies and designs influence how people interact with the world around them. 
                    While there is value in speed and efficiency that helps develop technologies and economies, 
                    there must be an awareness of how this speed and ease of use can be detrimental to our ability to critically engage and 
                    analyse what we experience on a societal level. It may therefore be favorable to sacrifice speed and 
                    efficiency and create more engaging designs and content that will help others develop habits in critical thinking and 
                    reflection that prevents them from being misled and taken advantage of.
