                <p id="Introduction">
                    Hypertext plays an integral role in how we interact with web pages and navigate the World Wide Web (WWW). 
                    With the ease of access to the massive amounts of information contained within the WWW, 
                    it is becoming increasingly important to understand what it does, 
                    how it works and its implications regarding quick communication in a societal and cultural environment.
                </p>

                <p id="Body">
                    Hypertext is a system that displays the information of a web page on a screen via a browser. 
                    The system can also show references to different parts of a web page via links in the same way an index or 
                    bibliography of a written work can guide a reader to different chapters or sources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are a few things to note in this comparison. 
                    The first being the difference in effort between navigating through links and navigating from an index to a page. 
                    One only need to click on a hyperlink, and it will take you to the information or section it is refencing (MDN, 2019).                
                    While an index or bibliography may guide a reader to additional resources, 
                    the reader still needs to physically find the resources themselves before they can access it. Secondly, 
                    Hypertext can hold and display a wide variety of different media (like videos, images and songs) along side text. 
                    This means that hypertext have a lot more potential in what they can display and give access to. 
                    This also applies to the way in which information is displayed as links provide a non-sequential way of viewing web pages but that will be discussed in more detail later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before continuing I would like to elaborate on the technical details regarding the links mentioned above.
                     The link use in hypertext has two parts, the anchor and the hyperlink. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hyperlink is a programmable reference that basically keeps information on where a webpage or information is stored however the reference and information is not visible to the user. 
                    The anchor is the visual representation of the link and usually informs the user on what the link leads to (MDN,2019). 
                    Anchors are usually displayed as, but not limited to, highlighted text description or images that help them standout to the user and may guide them into clicking it. 
                    This is what allows web pages to be viewed on sequentially as links can be designed as structured networks that can be traversed if a link is present. 
                    A simple example can be seen on a Wikipedia page, 
                    that contains a contents menu that links to different section of it like an <a href="#Introduction">introduction</a> , <a href="#Body">body</a>,  
                    <a href="#Conclusion"> conclusion</a> and <a href="#References">references</a> sections.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    From this we, we can understand how hypertext helps us navigate information on a webpage and how it takes less effort to use in comparison to older systems. 
                    However, hyperlinks also allow for a similar functionality and structure in navigation for the WWW. 
                    So far, we have only been discussing its uses in a more academic light with regards to convenience in accessibility to what we assume are credible sources. 
                    In The hyperlink as organizing principle (Halavais, 2008), it mentions several things to note regarding the hyperlink and social behaviour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first to note are the interactions between users, web browser search engines and hyperlinks and the social implications of linking or referencing different sources or webpages. 
                    Search engines help users navigate the WWW by presenting links to web pages that may relate to the users search criteria. 
                    The google search engine uses a few criteria to narrow and prioritise what links to show the user. 
                    One of them is how many other webpages have links that lead to the webpage in question. 
                    This is important as links and webpages can be generated by any user and this search criteria could then be manipulated through that. 
                    <br>
                    Additionally, we need to consider what the number of links that point to a web site could imply to users. 
                    Halavais discusses the purpose of citing and its social implications. 
                    Citing can have many purposes such as directing one to additional information, 
                    using a source to support and argument that is for or against that source, or purely for sharing with other people. 
                    A more common perception when one is aware of how many links refer to a web page is that the information it carries is credible as many people or websites are referring to it. 
                    While the websites that a search engine presents may be credible, it’s possible that it also conditions its users into believing that the quickest and most heard of information is always credible. 
                    However, by this logic we could say that any widespread rumour is also credible which is not case. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secondly, hyperlinks can be tracked in such a way that we can determine the physical location in which the hyperlink connects to. 
                    This means we can identify links between different locations around the world and begin analysing what those connections are and how they may influence each other. 
                    These connections could be a number of things such as common interests in hobbies or similar or differing ideologies and cultures between different countries. 
                    This information can be analysed to figure out the behaviour of different people or even find out where one might try, and place adds for businesses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, Halavais takes notice of the second order effect in which people begin to adapt when they become aware of their actions on the WWW being monitored. 
                    This means two things. 
                    It becomes increasingly difficult to use the WWW as a medium to understand societal behaviour as people’s actions will become more controlled with the awareness that their actions can be seen my millions of other people. 
                    This also means that people are becoming aware of the capabilities of hypertext and the WWW and will adapt accordingly in order to protect themselves. 
                    As a result, the WWW becomes a place in which users are self-governing its use and considering information found on it more carefully to avoid potential abuse.
                </p>

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    What this all means is that hypertext and the WWW as a whole are extremely efficient and convenient tools for communication and social interactions. 
                    However, the tools themselves cannot regulate the credibility of the information found there nor the moral integrity of the people that use it. 
                    With the situations in which rumours spread or information is used to take advantage of others, 
                    it is important to note that these issues have always been prevalent in human society and did not arise from the WWW. 
                    It has merely encouraged the basic social behaviour of human communication, for better and worse, and increased the speed and accessibility in which we interact with it. 
                    Perhaps the biggest concern would be that the speed at which information is distributed as well as how society acts within the WWW and adapt to it is becoming increasingly greater than the rate at which we can understand it.
