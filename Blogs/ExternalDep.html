                    In the same way that the availability of resources and technology has an effect on how we interact with and see the world around us
                    , different technologies can also be dependent on the situation of their use as well as other tools and 
                    factors that are connected to them. This article explains the use of Bootstrap, 
                    an expansive js and css library, on this website. 
                    It also discusses the rationale behind its use from a technical perspective and what it can contribute to the 
                    creative side of the website. 
                    Lastly, there will be a discussion of external dependencies like Bootstrap with relation to the 
                    Theoretical blog posts of this site.
                </p>
        
                <p id="Bootstrap">
                    Bootstrap is a large collection of premade css and js resources that help in creating a responsive website using mostly 
                    html to make use of while being customizable. Bootstrap also has documentation of how to use their various features on their website. 
                    It’s important to note that Bootstrap’s use is dependent on jquery and popper.js. 
                    While you can access and use the Bootstrap libraries via their cached content delivery network (cdn), 
                    you can’t view or customize different scripts or style guides without storing them locally.
                </p>

                <p id="Implementation">
                    In this context, Bootstrap was used to implement a carousel system that displays title images from the hobby blog posts 
                    that act as a link to their respective webpages. 
                    The intended use for this was to showcase a number of random blog posts on the website to catch a users attention to the different topics 
                    it discusses. However it was restricted to the hobby posts as none of the theory articles had a title image to represent them. 
                    While I could have implemented the carousel myself using html, css and js, Bootstrap also provides a number of other tools and 
                    elements that can help build a website. These include elements like forms or grids that help in building a 
                    comment section for the different blog posts and articles as well as many different color schemes that could brighten my dull looking site.
                    <br><br>
                    While Bootstrap provides a number of useful prebuilt components and code that enables for  
                    faster website development while being a more available tool to less experienced developers there are a few concerns to note. 
                    Bootstrap’s css and js components work in tandem and are dependent on each other. 
                    This means that there may be overlap in cases where you are making your own style sheet like I did on this site's main page. 
                    This is more an oversight on my part however as I didn’t use Bootstrap and its various tools and presets from the beginning.
                </p>

                <p id="Theory">
                    While Bootstrap makes the process of developing a website easier, 
                    there’s also the concern that it serves to widen knowledge and skill gaps between content creators who 
                    know the inner workings of these tools at a programming level versus those who only know how to make use of these libraries. 
                    This brings the risk of possible abuse in which features we are unaware and 
                    may have unethical implication find their way into content that is integrated into our daily lives, 
                    where we may be unable to identify these problems before it’s too late. 
                    This is reinforced by the use of cdn links that import scripts via the internet rather than storing locally, 
                    meaning that you can’t view or customize the scripts in your chosen editor. 
                    Furthermore, after taking a look at their css style sheet, 
                    I can say without a doubt that it is not meant to be viewed or edited by other people and definitely not reader friendly. 
                    For the most part, using Bootstrap is more about learning to use their preset components and scripts than learning css and js coding. 
                    Bootstrap does however have its own documentation that helps facilitate learning how to use and customize it. Additionally, 
                    one would still need to be experienced in html when making use of this framework in order to create an accessible and responsive website. 
                </p>

                <p id="Conclusion">
                    Bootstrap is indeed a helpful and powerful frame-work that makes web development easier and more accessible to a wider range of people. 
                    However, we need to consider the possibility of disempowerment when lowering the barrier of entry into possibly complex fields rather than 
                    endeavoring to raise the average skill levels to the point where the majority of 
                    people are aware of the capabilities and implications of design in technologies and services that are a major part of their daily lives.
                </p>
