                    Introduction
                </h2>

                <p id="Introduction Paragraph">
                    With modern technology, we now have instant access to information from places that are both near and far thanks to the internet. 
                    Additionally, we can learn from not just the content of information but their origins and mode of distribution. 
                    This article is a close reading of To a Study of Informational Geographies (Graham et al,2015), 
                    a research paper that looks at a wide range of statistics pertaining to access, 
                    contribution and representation of information over the internet. 
                    The close reading will discuss their aims, methodology, results and conclusions.
                </p>
            
                <h2>
                    Their Aims
                </h2>

                <p id="analysis of aims">
                    The paper looks at global statistics that cover the different aspects of information on the internet 
                    with the goal of identifying patterns in its origins, distribution, accessibility and who or what it represents. 
                    It explains their importance by using immutable mobiles ;
                    mobile and physical mediums of information that can’t be instantly changed like maps or postcards; 
                    as an example of how information affects our awareness of the physical world and to what extent we can interact with it.
                    <br>
                    The internet has the capability of distributing information of the WWW to faraway locations just like immutable mobiles. 
                    It has proved more convenient than immutable mobiles since they can be accessed from any location through the internet whereas 
                    immutable mobiles will have fixed locations of distribution like book stores or libraries.
                    This brings us to the importance of analysing different global statistics of the internet.
                    <br>
                    The primary concern in this regard would be levels of accessibility at a global scale. 
                    The reason for this is that the internet can play a huge role in providing equal opportunities to more people (Emmanuel.O , 2018). 
                    It provides convenient methods of networking and information gathering and a lack of access to it is a massive disadvantage in the current era. 
                    Being aware of any inequalities can therefore raise further questions on issues faced by certain places as well as the authenticity of information.
                     An important example raised in the paper a restaurant loses its function if it can’t be found on a map, 
                     leaving others unaware of its existence. 
                     In the same vein, 
                     if there are demographics that lack access to the internet and the WWW, 
                     they also lack the ability to communicate and represent themselves to the rest of the world on the same playing field.
                    There are a number of conditions that may hinder accessibility and these will be discussed in the results section of this article.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Their methodology
                </h2>

                <p id="Summary of methodology">
                    The study uses data gathered from established institutions (where the data is publicly available) 
                    and a number of specific data collection tools in which the scale was limited to that of a country. 
                    Each data set is then represented geographically on a map with their respective origins and discussed accordingly in the paper. 
                    It’s important to note that the study uses a variety of tools and sources, each for their own specific purpose in this study. 
                    Therefore this section will be covering methodology that is common among each data set and section. 
                    These sources and tools include Github, The World Bank, The International telecommunications Union,Google Search, 
                    Open Street Map and Wikipedia. 
                    Further details on the methodology of each data set will be discussed in the results section.
                </p>

                <p id="Analysis of methodoloy">
                    The mapping of data gives an easy to understand representation of each data set in how they are distributed physically on a global scale. 
                    The discussion of their methods and results are categorized under 3 geographies of information and structured around each data set. 
                    This is to maintain the focus of discussion around each data set as the different geographies may correlate to varying degrees 
                    but also bear varying implications. 
                    <br>
                    Since the research is done on a global scale, 
                    it becomes difficult to pinpoint specific reasonings for the data they’ve gathered in each location, 
                    however they are aware of this and the data serves as a foundation in which different geographies can be viewed, 
                    analysed and compared holistically on a global scale. 
                    This paper can then serve as a basis in which further research can stem from.

                </p>

                <h2>Their results</h2>


                <p id="Results Introduction">
                    The discussion of results will be covered in the following sections and subsections mentioned in the paper:
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Geographies of Access and enablement:
                </h3>

                <p id="Internet Penetration">
                    Internet penetration: This data set is represented by a map that contains information on the number of internet users per country 
                    and the percentage of the population that has access to the internet. 
                    The population of each country is represented by a number of hexagons that are orientated to 
                    resemble their geographical location seen on maps. 
                    Larger clusters of hexagons represent large internet user populations with the shade of 
                    red representing internet penetration. This leads into the 2 main patterns that are noted in the paper. 
                    The 1st is the growing internet population in Asia which accounted for 42% of the world's internet users in 2011. 
                    Secondly, Europe is primarily the area in which internet penetration is above 80%, 
                    with many countries in the Southern Hemisphere having around 40% and lower penetration. 
                    While the exact reasoning for these numbers are not accounted for, 
                    we can see that a large portion of the world lacks internet access. 
                    Furthermore, with this information we can take a deeper look at both countries with high or low internet penetration and 
                    compare the conditions that help or hinder internet accessibility.
                </p>

                <p id="Broadband Affordability">
                    Broadband Affordability: 
                    The affordability of internet access in this data set is gauged relative to each country's respective internet costs and average wage. 
                    This helps readers understand the data better as it contextualises each country's situation for the reader. 
                    In this section, the most notable pattern is the levels of unaffordability of the internet in most African countries. 
                    The paper credits this to relatively low wages rather than high internet costs, which ranges up to 250% of average income. 
                    Therefore, we can say that cost is a major barrier that accounts for the low penetration rates of the internet in most African countries. 
                    However, it must be noted that affordable internet does not translate to internet accessibility as there are still many other factors to 
                    take into account. A <a href="AlternativeLearningArticle.html">previous article regarding online learning in South Africa</a> mentions other difficulties that affect internet activity. 
                    These include infrastructures that support fast and stable internet connectivity as well as electricity to power necessary 
                    technologies like computers.  If internet connectivity is slow or unstable, it becomes frustrating to use and 
                    its capabilities become limited in the type of media one can access or distribute. In this case, 
                    paying for internet access is an added cost to an unreliable resource that could be spent on other necessities if finances were an issue. 
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Geographies of Participation:
                </h3>

                <p id="Global trends in participation">
                    The paper used domain name, 
                    github contributions and wikipedia edits to gauge the levels of participation of each country in content creation, 
                    software contribution and information respectively. 
                    Within domain names, 
                    the paper notes that a vast majority of content is hosted under American or 
                    European domain names despite these areas having relatively lower internet user populations compared to places like China. 
                    A similar trend is seen in Github users and contributions,although to a lesser extent, 
                    with the majority of collaborative software contributions being concentrated in America and Europe. 
                    This could potentially be a mirror or extension of the globalisation of more influential western economies and cultures. 
                    This indicates that higher internet populations don’t necessarily produce more information or digital content.
                    <br>
                    The number of Wikipedia edits per country follow the same trend seen in domain names and Github contributions. 
                    However, an important data set to note is the percentage of articles about a country that were authored/edited locally. 
                    In it, we find that information on most parts of the world are being created from foreign sources with most African 
                    countries having the least amount of local representation. 
                    This is alarming since Wikipedia is a public platform that allows anyone to edit their information. 
                    The authenticity of information regarding these areas can therefore be called into question as they may lack 
                    the cultural understanding or context needed to represent fairly and without misconception. 
                    Another concern would be the propagation of malicious misinformation that can spread from online platforms and 
                    while said misinformation can also be publicly reviewed, 
                    the ability to do so might not be accessible to those involved as previously mentioned in Geographies of accessibility.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Geographies of Representation.
                </h3>

                <p id="Over and under representation">
                    For this section, 
                    the paper gauges levels in representation by using different platforms like search engines and 
                    geonames to identify the amount of information pertaining to different areas of the world. 
                    The paper once again notes the pattern of inequalities between the Global North and Global South in which they are over-represented and 
                    under-represented respectively. 
                    In the previous sections we discuss the implications regarding the authenticity of information and 
                    the ability to represent oneself and their local affiliation. 
                    However what are the implications of over and under representation ? 
                    Under representation, or lack of awareness, 
                    may prevent us from understanding different people and cultures in the world. 
                    This lack of understanding can affect communication and prevent possible problems from coming to light. 
                    Over-representation can have a similar effect as it may take over the global perception of what cultural, 
                    economic and political norms look like while over-shadowing the many different cultures and methods around the world with sheer screen time.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Their Conclusions
                </h2>

                <p id="conclusions">
                    The paper concludes that while there are major inequalities between the Global North and 
                    Global South despite the mass increase of internet users globally, 
                    the paper serves as a starting point in which future research can be done to understand and fix these issues. 
                    It is important to note that how information is created, represented and distributed is very much tied to these inequalities. 
                    These inequalities need to be researched in further detail in order for them to be overcome, 
                    baring in mind that the reason for them may differ from location to location. 
                    Therefore the causes and implications of these problems may encompass different fields of study with regards to each location's cultural, 
                    economic and political situations. 
                    On top of that, how does under/over-representation affect our perception of the world and others on both an individual and societal level ? 
                    Could the over-representation of a place and culture affect what we perceive as the global norm to strive for ? 
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Authors rant
                </h2>

                <p id="Thoughts">
                    Honestly, I found writing this close reading to be very difficult. 
                    Due to the broad nature of the study, I found myself trying to do additional research only to exclude said research 
                    as I felt it was either too specific or I didn’t have a proper grasp on each of the different fields it concerned. 
                    This is understandable though, as it’s meant to be the basis for which further and more specific studies could be made. 
                    The biggest difficulty for me was discussing representation and its possible implications in the given context.For the most part, 
                    I feel like I’m too personally vested in how both under and over-representation, 
                    even on a smaller scale, can affect one's perception of other people and lead to misunderstanding and conflict. 
                    To be honest I don’t even know why I'm typing all this out. Perhaps it's the panic and sleep deprivation talking?
                    Anyway, rant over.
