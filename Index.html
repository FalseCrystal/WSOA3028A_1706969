                    The Library of babel likens the world as many infinite libraries made up of all the information and data in the world as well as each personal understanding of it. 
                    It speaks of the continual search for understanding that takes generations of time to develop, as well as how to make the research and development of the specific information we’re looking for faster.

                    What’s interesting to note is the type interaction between people of differing beliefs in which said understandings try to overwrite each other to validate themselves rather than potentially improve themselves.
                    It shows a worrying mindset of the pursuit of knowledge and flaunting what was found rather than understanding and continually taking different outlooks to further that understanding.
                    The ease of access to information that the internet gives us is no different than the library of babel since it, at its core, is something that consists of human libraries and therefore still requires time for people to evaluate different sources before coming to a proper conclusion.
                    While the internet itself has made the search process significantly more efficient, it has not changed the desire to affirm what one knows as “the truth”.

                    In a way the efficiency that the internets speed has brought can be considered mitigated by the speed at which conflicting information and arguments can occur on it.

                    In a time where technologies are constantly developing,
                    it is important to note how those technologies are used by both companies/developers and users. 
                    Considerations towards how these new technologies fit in to current legislature, economy and society must be made. 
                    This is to ensure that the technology is used in a fair and ethical manner in each sphere.

                    From the previous reading, As we may think, we find that while technological development and innovations may bring various advantages to everyday life, it is often driven by financial viability.
                    This by itself presents no problems, however the anti-trust court case involving Netscape and Microsoft reveals a big problem when dealing with emerging markets that deal in new innovations.
                    The primary problem in the court case was the business practices that Microsoft employed to hinder the progress of other companies in developing newer technologies.
                    These practices basically forced possible future competitors to either go bankrupt or be bought out by Microsoft, essentially creating a monopoly over the computer software industry at the time.

                    Government enforced limitations over Microsoft thanks to the anti-trust court case.
                    The resulting legislature regarding the case pushed for competitivity to prevent monopolies, after all who else would sooner point out foul or unethical play if not one’s own rivals.
                    However, it is important to note that the development of software is often very fast in comparison to the speed of court proceedings and legislative matters.
                    By the time the case was settled, Netscape had already suffered significant losses.

                    It becomes evident that with the rapid growth in productivity that technology brings, there are also new problems that result from them.
                    Taking this case and past innovations such as the automobile into account, we can see that possible consequences and how to deal with them are only considered after the effects have taken hold.
